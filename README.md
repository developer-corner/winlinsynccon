MS Windows and Linux concurrency and synchronization (threads, mutexes, events)

This tiny github project consists of a PDF document only. It explains the very basics of threads, mutexes, and events (MS Windows) and POSIX threads, POSIX mutexes, and POSIX condition variables on Linux.

Moreover, the Linux *eventfd* (event file descriptors) mechanism is explained.

Using this guideline, you can implement C/C++ source code working on both operating systems MS Windows and Linux using comparable concurrency and synchronization primitives.

The current document version is 1.0 dated 05/09/2024. ENJOY!
